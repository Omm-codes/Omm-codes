👋 Hey, I’m Om Chavan  

I'm building **NextWatch**, a React-based movie discovery app that helps users explore, search, and track films using public APIs. I’m planning to expand it into a cross-platform app with Capacitor soon.

### 🔧 What I'm working on
- Building full-stack projects with React, Node, and APIs  
- Experimenting with AI-driven automation and negotiation systems  
- Improving backend performance and scalability (APIs, DB optimization)

### 💡 Looking to collaborate on
Projects in web dev, AI, or anything that solves real-world problems.

### 🌱 Learning right now
- Advanced React patterns  
- Django/Flask backend workflows  
- AI + automation systems

### 💬 Ask me about
API design, full-stack workflows, and structuring scalable projects.

### ⚡ Fun fact
I love building projects around problems I personally face—it keeps things practical and fun.
